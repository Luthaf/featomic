What is rascaline
=================

Calculations of structural representations or also fingerprints is at the core
atomistic machine learning. There exist several libraries for calcuting a
structural representation. An important aspect in the calculation is speed and
memory's efficiency. Rascaline was explicitly designed to fullfill these to
aspects with the target to run machine learned molecular simulation.
Especially the memory efficiency is achieved by using the equistore container
format for storing the structural representation. Additionally, rascaline is
not limited to a single representation style but supports several.
